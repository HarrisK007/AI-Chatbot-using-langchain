ðŸš€ Excited to Share My AI-Chatbot-Using-Langchain Project ðŸš€

I've been working on a powerful chatbot application using Langchain, Google's Generative AI, and Streamlit, and I'm thrilled with how it's turned out! This project focuses on building an interactive, multi-chat session interface with role-based AI responses across different sectors like Healthcare, Finance, and Education.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

Multi-session chat management
Role-based responses (customized for general, healthcare, finance, and education queries)
Dynamic chat titling based on conversation content
Clean and intuitive UI with a conversational design

ðŸ¤– This was an amazing opportunity to dive deeper into building scalable, user-friendly AI applications. I'm excited to see how this can transform personalized AI interactions!

ðŸ‘‰ I'd love for you to try it out and share your feedback with me! Your insights will be invaluable in improving and refining this tool.
